## CI Completeness Policy

**This project is managed through AgilePlus.**

## AgilePlus Mandate

All work MUST be tracked in AgilePlus:
- Reference: `/Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos/AgilePlus`
- CLI: `cd /Users/kooshapari/CodeProjects/Phenotype/repos/AgilePlus && agileplus <command>`

## Work Requirements

1. **Check for AgilePlus spec before implementing**
2. **Create spec for new work**: `agileplus specify --title "<feature>" --description "<desc>"`
3. **Update work package status**: `agileplus status <feature-id> --wp <wp-id> --state <state>`
4. **No code without corresponding AgilePlus spec**

## Branch Discipline

- Feature branches in `repos/worktrees/<project>/<category>/<branch>`
- Canonical repository tracks `main` only
- Return to `main` for merge/integration checkpoints

## UTF-8 Encoding

All markdown files must use UTF-8.

---



- Always evaluate and fix ALL CI check failures on a PR, including pre-existing failures inherited from main.
- Never dismiss a CI failure as "pre-existing" or "unrelated to our changes" — if it fails on the PR, fix it in the PR.
- This includes: build, lint, test, docs build, security scanning (CodeQL), code review gates (CodeRabbit), workflow guard checks, and any other CI jobs.
- When a failure is caused by infrastructure outside the branch (e.g., rate limits, external service outages), implement or improve automated retry/bypass mechanisms in CI workflows.
- After fixing CI failures, verify locally where possible (build, vet, tests) before pushing.

## Phenotype Git and Delivery Workflow Protocol <!-- PHENOTYPE_GIT_DELIVERY_PROTOCOL -->

- Use branch-based delivery with pull requests; do not rely on direct default-branch writes where rulesets apply.
- Prefer stacked PRs for multi-part changes so each PR is small, reviewable, and independently mergeable.
- Keep PRs linear and scoped: one concern per PR, explicit dependency order for stacks, and clear migration steps.
- Enforce CI and required checks strictly: do not merge until all required checks and policy gates are green.
- Resolve all review threads and substantive PR comments before merge; do not leave unresolved reviewer feedback.
- Follow repository coding standards and best practices (typing, tests, lint, docs, security) before requesting merge.
- Rebase or restack to keep branches current with target branch and to avoid stale/conflicting stacks.
- When a ruleset or merge policy blocks progress, surface the blocker explicitly and adapt the plan (for example: open PR path, restack, or split changes).

## Phenotype Org Cross-Project Reuse Protocol <!-- PHENOTYPE_SHARED_REUSE_PROTOCOL -->

- Treat this repository as part of the broader Phenotype organization project collection, not an isolated codebase.
- During research and implementation, actively identify code that is sharable, modularizable, splittable, or decomposable for reuse across repositories.
- When reusable logic is found, prefer extraction into existing shared modules/projects first; if none fit, propose creating a new shared module/project.
- Include a `Cross-Project Reuse Opportunities` section in plans with candidate code, target shared location, impacted repos, and migration order.
- For cross-repo moves or ownership-impacting extractions, ask the user for confirmation on destination and rollout, then bake that into the execution plan.
- Execute forward-only migrations: extract shared code, update all callers, and remove duplicated local implementations.

## Phenotype Long-Term Stability and Non-Destructive Change Protocol <!-- PHENOTYPE_LONGTERM_STABILITY_PROTOCOL -->

- Optimize for long-term platform value over short-term convenience; choose durable solutions even when implementation complexity is higher.
- Classify proposed changes as `quick_fix` or `stable_solution`; prefer `stable_solution` unless an incident response explicitly requires a temporary fix.
- Do not use deletions/reversions as the default strategy; prefer targeted edits, forward fixes, and incremental hardening.
- Prefer moving obsolete or superseded material into `.archive/` over destructive removal when retention is operationally useful.
- Prefer clean manual merges, explicit conflict resolution, and auditable history over forceful rewrites, force merges, or history-destructive workflows.
- Prefer completing unused stubs into production-quality implementations when they represent intended product direction; avoid leaving stubs ignored indefinitely.
- Do not merge any PR while any check is failing, including non-required checks, unless the user gives explicit exception approval.
- When proposing a quick fix, include a scheduled follow-up path to a stable solution in the same plan.

## Worktree Discipline

- Feature work goes in `.worktrees/<topic>/`
- Legacy `PROJECT-wtrees/` and `repo-wtrees/` roots are for migration only and must not receive new work.
- Canonical repository remains on `main` for final integration and verification.

## Architecture

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)

This project follows Hexagonal Architecture with clear separation of concerns:

## TypeScript Validation Standard

All TypeScript projects use **Zod** (^3.24.2+) for runtime validation:

- **React forms**: Use `@hookform/resolvers` for react-hook-form + Zod integration
- **APIs**: Use `zod-to-json-schema` for JSON Schema generation from Zod schemas
- **Schema location**: Define all validation schemas in `src/schemas/` directory
- **Runtime validation**: Always use `.safeParse()` for validation with proper error handling
- **No custom validators**: Use Zod's built-in methods and composable validators
- **Type safety**: Leverage Zod's `z.infer<typeof schema>` for TypeScript type inference

See `docs/reference/VALIDATION_STANDARDS.md` for detailed patterns and examples.

## Python Configuration Standard

All Python projects use **pydantic-settings v2.x** for configuration management:

- **Base pattern**: Composite `BaseSettings` with `SettingsConfigDict`
- **Environment loading**: Auto `.env` loading via `env_file='.env'` in Config
- **Field validators**: Use type hints, descriptions, and range validation on all config fields
- **Consistent env prefix**: Define per-project prefix (e.g., `THGENT_*`, `AGILEPLUS_*`)
- **Type safety**: All fields typed; use `Annotated` for validation metadata
- **Immutability**: Configure `ConfigDict(frozen=True)` for production configs

See `docs/reference/CONFIGURATION_STANDARDS.md` for detailed patterns and examples.
