# Agent Rules for AgilePlus Projects

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: All AI agents working in this project must follow these rules.

These rules apply to **all commands** (specify, plan, research, tasks, implement, review, merge, etc.).

---

## 1. Path Reference Rule

**When you mention directories or files, provide either the absolute path or a path relative to the project root.**

✅ **CORRECT**:
- `agileplus/001-feature/tasks/WP01.md`
- `/Users/robert/Code/myproject/agileplus/001-feature/spec.md`
- `tasks/WP01.md` (relative to feature directory)

❌ **WRONG**:
- "the tasks folder" (which one? where?)
- "WP01.md" (in which lane? which feature?)
- "the spec" (which feature's spec?)

**Why**: Clarity and precision prevent errors. Never refer to a folder by name alone.

## 2. UTF-8 Encoding Rule

**When writing ANY markdown, JSON, YAML, CSV, or code files, use ONLY UTF-8 compatible characters.**

### What to Avoid (Will Break the Dashboard)

❌ **Windows-1252 smart quotes**: " " ' ' (from Word/Outlook/Office)
❌ **Em/en dashes and special punctuation**: — –
❌ **Copy-pasted arrows**: → (becomes illegal bytes)
❌ **Multiplication sign**: × (0xD7 in Windows-1252)
❌ **Plus-minus sign**: ± (0xB1 in Windows-1252)
❌ **Degree symbol**: ° (0xB0 in Windows-1252)
❌ **Copy/paste from Microsoft Office** without cleaning

**Real examples that crashed the dashboard:**
- "User's favorite feature" → "User's favorite feature" (smart quote)
- "Price: $100 ± $10" → "Price: $100 +/- $10"
- "Temperature: 72°F" → "Temperature: 72 degrees F"
- "3 × 4 matrix" → "3 x 4 matrix"

### What to Use Instead

✅ Standard ASCII quotes: `"`, `'`
✅ Hyphen-minus: `-` instead of en/em dash
✅ ASCII arrow: `->` instead of →
✅ Lowercase `x` for multiplication
✅ `+/-` for plus-minus
✅ ` degrees` for temperature
✅ Plain punctuation

### Safe Characters

✅ Emoji (proper UTF-8)  
✅ Accented characters typed directly: café, naïve, Zürich  
✅ Unicode math typed directly (√ ≈ ≠ ≤ ≥)  

### Copy/Paste Guidance

1. Paste into a plain-text buffer first (VS Code, TextEdit in plain mode)
2. Replace smart quotes and dashes
3. Verify no � replacement characters appear
4. Run `agileplus validate-encoding --feature <feature-id>` to check
5. Run `agileplus validate-encoding --feature <feature-id> --fix` to auto-repair

**Failure to follow this rule causes the dashboard to render blank pages.**

### Auto-Fix Available

If you accidentally introduce problematic characters:
```bash
# Check for encoding issues
agileplus validate-encoding --feature 001-my-feature

# Automatically fix all issues (creates .bak backups)
agileplus validate-encoding --feature 001-my-feature --fix

# Check all features at once
agileplus validate-encoding --all --fix
```

---

## 3. Context Management Rule

**Build the context you need, then maintain it intelligently.**

- Session start (0 tokens): You have zero context. Read plan.md, tasks.md, relevant artifacts.  
- Mid-session (you already read them): Use your judgment—don’t re-read everything unless necessary.  
- Never skip relevant information; do skip redundant re-reads to save tokens.  
- Rely on the steps in the command you are executing.

---

## 4. Work Quality Rule

**Produce secure, tested, documented work.**

- Follow the plan and constitution requirements.  
- Prefer existing patterns over invention.  
- Treat security warnings as fatal—fix or escalate.  
- Run all required tests before claiming work is complete.  
- Be transparent: state what you did, what you didn’t, and why.

---

## 5. Git Discipline Rule

**Keep commits clean and auditable.**

- Commit only meaningful units of work.
- Write descriptive commit messages (imperative mood).
- Do not rewrite history of shared branches.
- Keep feature branches up to date with main via merge or rebase as appropriate.
- Never commit secrets, tokens, or credentials.

---

## 6. Git Best Practices for Agent Directories

**NEVER commit agent directories to git.**

### Why Agent Directories Must Not Be Committed

Agent directories like `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.gemini/` contain:
- Authentication tokens and API keys
- User-specific credentials (auth.json)
- Session data and conversation history
- Temporary files and caches

### What Should Be Committed

✅ **DO commit:**
- `.kittify/templates/` - Command templates (source)
- `.kittify/missions/` - Mission definitions
- `.kittify/memory/constitution.md` - Project constitution
- `.gitignore` - With all agent directories excluded

❌ **DO NOT commit:**
- `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.gemini/`, etc. - Agent runtime directories
- `.kittify/templates/command-templates/` - These are templates, not final commands
- Any `auth.json`, `credentials.json`, or similar files

### Automatic Protection

AgilePlus automatically:
1. Adds all agent directories to `.gitignore` during `agileplus init`
2. Installs pre-commit hook to block accidental commits
3. Creates `.claudeignore` to optimize AI scanning

### Manual Verification

```bash
# Verify .gitignore protection
cat .gitignore | grep -E '\.(claude|codex|gemini|cursor)/'

# Check for accidentally staged agent files
git status | grep -E '\.(claude|codex|gemini|cursor)/'

# If you find staged agent files, unstage them:
git reset HEAD .claude/
```

### Worktree Constitution Sharing

In worktrees, `.kittify/memory/` is a symlink to the main repo's memory,
ensuring all feature branches share the same constitution.

```bash
# In a worktree, this should show a symlink:
ls -la .kittify/memory
# lrwxr-xr-x ... .kittify/memory -> ../../../.kittify/memory
```

This is intentional and correct - it ensures a single source of truth for project principles.

### Quick Reference

- 📁 **Paths**: Always specify exact locations.  
- 🔤 **Encoding**: UTF-8 only. Run the validator when unsure.  
- 🧠 **Context**: Read what you need; don’t forget what you already learned.  
- ✅ **Quality**: Follow secure, tested, documented practices.  
- 📝 **Git**: Commit cleanly with clear messages.
## Child-Agent and Delegation Policy
- Use child agents liberally for scoped discovery, audits, multi-repo scans, and implementation planning before direct parent-agent edits.
- Prefer delegating high-context or high-churn tasks to subagents, and keep parent-agent changes focused on integration and finalization.
- Reserve parent-agent direct writes for the narrowest, final decision layer.

## Child Agent Usage
- Use child agents liberally for discovery-heavy, migration-heavy, and high-context work.
- Delegate broad scans, decomposition, and implementation waves to subagents before final parent-agent integration.
- Keep the parent lane focused on deterministic integration and finalization.
- Preserve explicit handoffs and cross-agent context in session notes and audits.


## CI Completeness Policy

- Always evaluate and fix ALL CI check failures on a PR, including pre-existing failures inherited from main.
- Never dismiss a CI failure as "pre-existing" or "unrelated to our changes" — if it fails on the PR, fix it in the PR.
- This includes: build, lint, test, docs build, security scanning (CodeQL), code review gates (CodeRabbit), workflow guard checks, and any other CI jobs.
- When a failure is caused by infrastructure outside the branch (e.g., rate limits, external service outages), implement or improve automated retry/bypass mechanisms in CI workflows.
- After fixing CI failures, verify locally where possible (build, vet, tests) before pushing.

## Phenotype Git and Delivery Workflow Protocol <!-- PHENOTYPE_GIT_DELIVERY_PROTOCOL -->

- Use branch-based delivery with pull requests; do not rely on direct default-branch writes where rulesets apply.
- Prefer stacked PRs for multi-part changes so each PR is small, reviewable, and independently mergeable.
- Keep PRs linear and scoped: one concern per PR, explicit dependency order for stacks, and clear migration steps.
- Enforce CI and required checks strictly: do not merge until all required checks and policy gates are green.
- Resolve all review threads and substantive PR comments before merge; do not leave unresolved reviewer feedback.
- Follow repository coding standards and best practices (typing, tests, lint, docs, security) before requesting merge.
- Rebase or restack to keep branches current with target branch and to avoid stale/conflicting stacks.
- When a ruleset or merge policy blocks progress, surface the blocker explicitly and adapt the plan (for example: open PR path, restack, or split changes).

## Phenotype Org Cross-Project Reuse Protocol <!-- PHENOTYPE_SHARED_REUSE_PROTOCOL -->

- Treat this repository as part of the broader Phenotype organization project collection, not an isolated codebase.
- During research and implementation, actively identify code that is sharable, modularizable, splittable, or decomposable for reuse across repositories.
- When reusable logic is found, prefer extraction into existing shared modules/projects first; if none fit, propose creating a new shared module/project.
- Include a `Cross-Project Reuse Opportunities` section in plans with candidate code, target shared location, impacted repos, and migration order.
- For cross-repo moves or ownership-impacting extractions, ask the user for confirmation on destination and rollout, then bake that into the execution plan.
- Execute forward-only migrations: extract shared code, update all callers, and remove duplicated local implementations.

## Phenotype Long-Term Stability and Non-Destructive Change Protocol <!-- PHENOTYPE_LONGTERM_STABILITY_PROTOCOL -->

- Optimize for long-term platform value over short-term convenience; choose durable solutions even when implementation complexity is higher.
- Classify proposed changes as `quick_fix` or `stable_solution`; prefer `stable_solution` unless an incident response explicitly requires a temporary fix.
- Do not use deletions/reversions as the default strategy; prefer targeted edits, forward fixes, and incremental hardening.
- Prefer moving obsolete or superseded material into `.archive/` over destructive removal when retention is operationally useful.
- Prefer clean manual merges, explicit conflict resolution, and auditable history over forceful rewrites, force merges, or history-destructive workflows.
- Prefer completing unused stubs into production-quality implementations when they represent intended product direction; avoid leaving stubs ignored indefinitely.
- Do not merge any PR while any check is failing, including non-required checks, unless the user gives explicit exception approval.
- When proposing a quick fix, include a scheduled follow-up path to a stable solution in the same plan.

## Worktree Discipline

- Feature work goes in `.worktrees/<topic>/`
- Legacy `PROJECT-wtrees/` and `repo-wtrees/` roots are for migration only and must not receive new work.
- Canonical repository remains on `main` for final integration and verification.
